[1] Limits to 500 executed instructions. Comment indicates some
knowledge this is a bug, but that it should be limited to the actual
number of instructions. Neither is correct. Real CPUs run forever. You
may have a segmentation violation if you access memory that doesn't
exist on the physical system, but there is no instruction count limit.

[2] Assumes registers are initialized to 0, not in ISA

[3] Cache only works for first 16
